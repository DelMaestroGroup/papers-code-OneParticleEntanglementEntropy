# Project Code

- To reproduce LL numerical integrations and fits, run the notebook `LL_numerical_calculations.ipynb`
- Results are saved to `data` directory and can be loaded in the plotting code
- To reproduce all figures of the paper, run the notebook `generate_figures.ipynb`  

-  `load_data_utils.py` contains functions and definitions to load and preprocess data from ED and DMRG calculations
-  `LL_utils.py` contains functions and definitions of the LL solution
-  `analyze_data_utils.py` contains functions and definitions to process ED and DMRG data, extract finite size and steady state limits, ...
-  `colors.py` contains definitions and functions related to colorcycles used in the plots
